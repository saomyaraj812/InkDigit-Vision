## Introduction

This project implements a deep learning model for handwritten digit recognition using Python, NumPy, and scikit-learn. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset and is capable of accurately identifying and predicting numbers from handwritten digit images.

## Prerequisites

- Python
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Installation

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saomyaraj812/InkDigit-Vision.git  
cd yourproject  
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To train the model, run the following command:

```bash
python train.py
```

You can make predictions on new handwritten digit images using the following command:

```bash
python predict.py path/to/your/image.png
```

## Results

Here's an example of how to use the trained model to predict a handwritten digit in Python:

```bash
from my_model import predict_digit

image_path = 'path/to/your/image.png'
prediction = predict_digit(image_path)

print(f"Predicted digit: {prediction}")
````
